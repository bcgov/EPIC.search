"""Project inference service for automatically detecting project references in search queries.

This module provides intelligent project detection capabilities that analyze user queries
to identify project names and other project-related entities. When users ask questions 
like "Coyote Hydrogen project zoning and land use?", the system can automatically 
infer which project(s) they're referring to, apply appropriate filtering, and clean 
the query to focus on actual search terms without requiring explicit project IDs.

The service includes:
1. Named entity recognition for project names and project-related terms
2. Fuzzy matching against known project names in the projects table
3. Confidence scoring for automatic project inference based solely on project name similarity
4. Query cleaning to remove identified project names and focus on actual search topics
5. Integration with the search pipeline for transparent project filtering

Note: Project inference is based exclusively on project names from the projects table,
not on proponent organizations, to ensure focused and accurate project detection.

            # Role and Purpose
            Summarize the following environmental assessment-related documents received by the Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) of British Columbia. The summary should provide a **detailed** and comprehensive overview of all potentially significant environmental effects or considerations noted in the materials. The final summary must not exclude any details that could impact the environment. Include all relevant points under each category provided below. Ensure the summary is **accurate**, **neutral**, and **complete**.

            Details to be Included:

            - Mammals/Reptiles/Amphibians: Effects on habitat, habitat functionality, fragmentation, disturbance, mortality, movement, and health.

            Aquatic Resources and Freshwater Fish

            - Fish Habitat: Effects on riparian ecosystems, spawning locations, and in-stream flow.
            - Aquatic Resources: Effects on benthic invertebrates, periphyton, bioaccumulation, phytoplankton, zooplankton.
            - Fish: Effects on tissue quality, behavior, migration, health, development, Species at Risk, and traditionally important aquatic species.

            Marine Resources

            - Fish Habitat: Effects on eelgrass, kelp, and marine plants.
            - Marine Mammals: Effects on Species at Risk, behavior, underwater noise, and traditional use species.
            - Fish: Effects on species at risk, underwater noise, behavior, and species of management or traditional concern.
            - Marine Invertebrates: Effects on Species at Risk, management concern species, and traditional use species.

            Employment and Economy

            - Employment: Effects on jobs, training, labor income, and equitable access to opportunities.
            - Economy: Effects on tax revenues, government expenditures, GDP, business revenue, land and resource valuations, tourism, and cost of living.

            Land and Resource Use

            - Private Property: Effects on use and enjoyment of private properties.
            - Tenured Land and Resource Use: Effects on industrial land uses and other permitted/licensed land uses.
            - Public Land and Resource Use: Effects on hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering, recreation (camping, hiking, skiing, boating, etc.), agriculture, tourism.
